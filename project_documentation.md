# Project Documentation – Personal Health Coach

## Architecture
1. Input Layer – Raw health and lifestyle text
2. Compression Layer – Removes redundancy and structures data
3. Recommendation Layer – Generates concise wellness guidance

## Compression Strategy

- Removal of filler text
- Structured output formatting

## Evaluation

- Quality check of retained medical relevance

## Limitations

- Rule-based compression
